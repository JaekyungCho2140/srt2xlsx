## Core Development Principles

### 1. Zero Arbitrary Decisions
All implementation details must strictly follow the PRD.md specifications. If any detail is not specified in the PRD, stop development and seek clarification first.

### 2. Implementation Priorities
1. **Correctness over Speed**: Ensure accurate conversion and data integrity
2. **Stability over Features**: Focus on reliable core functionality
3. **Simplicity over Complexity**: Choose straightforward solutions

### 3. PRD.md is the Source of Truth
For all technical specifications, constraints, and implementation details, refer to:
- **ðŸ“‹ PRD v1.6.4**: `.claude/docs/PRD.md`
